# Testing

## Requirement evidence

| ID | Canonical | Evidence |
| --- | --- | --- |
| REQ-ThreeMDViewer-003 | REQ-ThreeMDViewer-003 | VIEWER-6 in `hi/tools.md`. `web/viewer.html` switches Edit and Preview in one panel and calls `render` for Preview. `uitests/viewer.spec.mjs` covers the desktop switch and the narrow Files and document switch. |

- `specsync check --spec ThreeMDViewer`
- `hi check` at the repository root
- Playwright `uitests/viewer.spec.mjs` passed 60 tests on Chromium and WebKit after the outline chip opens Preview first. The desktop and narrow layout tests passed again after the bar metadata hide.
